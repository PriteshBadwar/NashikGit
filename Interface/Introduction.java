package Interface;

public class Introduction {
//   Interface  : It is an entity which is used when we do not knoe the functionality implimentation
//				: Every class of the interface is the abstract class.
//	  1) Every class of the interface is the abstract class by default. 
//	  2) For Interface we have to use the extend keyword to access the property of other Interface
//	  3) To impliment Interface with class we have to use the impliments keyword with the class.
//	  4) We can impliment  n no of class with interface
//	  5)An interface can implements any number of interfaces at a time.
//	  6) Constructor is not applicable for interface.
//	  7) We can extends the class and implements the interface together but order must be extends followed by implements
//	  8) If a method is common in both interfaces then a class is implementing both interfaces, it has to define the method only once as it is common.
//	     But if the methods inside the interfaces are having different return type then it is not possible to implements both the interfaces by that class.
