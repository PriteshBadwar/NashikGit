package polymorphism;

public class Introduction {

//	1) polymorphism is one of the oop's concept through which we can achive portability.
//	2) poly = means many ,morphism = means forms. , means many forms of java.
//	3) Whenever we have same method name ,through which we can derive different logic is called as polymorphisum.
//	4) Polymorphism have two methods 
//			i) Overloading Method
//			ii)OverRiding Method
//	i) Overloading Method : 1) If two method's name are same then that method is overloaded method 
//	                         but atleast there order of argument should be different.
//							2)Return type doesen't make an issue for overloading.
//	                        3)Overloading rule is applicable for both static and non-static in which if a method is non static and other is static and they are having the same name but different argument then they are called as Overloaded method.
//							4)Execuation of overloading method depends on reference variable ,so it also
//							 called as compile time polymorphism.
//							** Called as static polymorphism.
//							5)Overloading is applicable for methods only not for variables.
//							6)Constructor follows overloading.
//	
//	ii)Overridding Method : If two methods having same method name,argument and having releationship of inheritence this is overridding.
//						1)Constructor do not follow overriding.
//						2)Return type for both the classes should be same.
//						3)Execuation of methods depends on rum time object so it is also called as run time polymorphism 
//						4) Also called as Dynamic polymorphism.
//						5)If method in parent class declared as private then method cannot be overridden in child class.
//						6) It is applicable for only non-static methods.
